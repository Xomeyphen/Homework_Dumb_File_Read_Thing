Week 7 HW:

Using Files—Numeric Processing

If you have downloaded this book’s source code from the companion Web site, you will find a file named Random.txt in the Chapter 05 folder. This file contains a long list of random numbers. I posted this file in Canvas as well if you cannot find it in the book web site. Copy the file to your hard drive and then write a program that opens the file, reads all the numbers from the file, and calculates the following:

A) The number of numbers in the file
B) The sum of all the numbers in the file (a running total)
C) The average of all the numbers in the file
The program should display the number of numbers
